# Fixes Applied to Game Cam WebApp

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Filter Interactivity
**Problem**: Checkboxes were unclickable and filters didn't work
**Solution**: 
- Updated `BottomPanel.jsx` to properly handle checkbox changes with onChange events
- Made checkboxes properly interactive with label elements
- Added Clear button alongside Select All for better UX

### 2. ✅ Video Player Tab
**Problem**: Clicking videos opened duplicate main tab instead of player
**Solution**:
- Fixed routing in `main.jsx` to properly handle `/player` path
- Updated `vite.config.js` to enable history fallback for client-side routing
- Fixed URL construction in `App.jsx` to use full origin URL

### 3. ✅ Missing Animals from JSON
**Problem**: Not all animals from JSON were showing in filters
**Solution**:
- Fixed backend filtering logic to handle videos with empty animals lists
- Added 'none' option to actions and additional_labels by default
- Updated filtering to properly match empty lists when 'none' is selected

### 4. ✅ Scrolling on Cam Sites
**Problem**: Couldn't scroll in the Cam Sites list
**Solution**:
- Already had `overflowY: "auto"` but increased visibility
- Set proper maxHeight (180px) for all filter lists
- Ensured consistent scrolling behavior across all filter panels

### 5. ✅ Play All/Play Selected Buttons
**Problem**: No way to play multiple videos
**Solution**:
- Added "Play All" button to play entire filtered video list
- Added "Play Selected" button with checkboxes for each video
- Updated video list to show meaningful names (date - site - animals)

### 6. ✅ Map-Filter Synchronization
**Problem**: Map site selection wasn't connected to filter panel
**Solution**:
- Passed selectedSites from App to BottomPanel
- Added bidirectional sync between map clicks and site checkboxes
- Map selections now properly trigger filter updates

### 7. ✅ Backend Server Configuration
**Problem**: Server wouldn't start due to incorrect module reference
**Solution**:
- Fixed `uvicorn.run()` to reference "main_server:app" instead of "app:app"

## Additional Improvements

- Added proper error handling patterns documentation
- Improved video list display with date, site, and animal information
- Fixed data filtering logic to handle 'none' cases for empty arrays
- Added comprehensive test scripts for debugging

## How to Run

1. Start both servers:
   ```bash
   # In one terminal:
   cd backend
   python main_server.py
   
   # In another terminal:
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Or use the batch script:
   ```bash
   run_servers.bat
   ```

3. Access the app at http://localhost:5173

## Testing

Run the API test to verify everything works:
```bash
cd backend
python test_api_final.py
```
